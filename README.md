# The Solution
Suppose, quite simply, you buy an item and resell it for a profit
Recording this in a spreadsheet is easy!

| Date | Name | Cost | Sold Date | Sold Val.| Profit |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 5/4/2024 | Hammer Drill | $15 | 8/16/2024 | $125 | $110 |

But suppose you purchase dozens of items in only one lot.
And one item is a box that has 27 of the same type of bearing
All of which need to be sold individually

Recording this can be a hassle with multiple spreadsheets interacting with each other


Now you can
* Enter simple items and their sale

	* Items
	* Sales
	* Pictures
